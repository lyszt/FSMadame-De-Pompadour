# Humanity Simulator
## The flesh is willing, but the soul has rotted.
---

This is Humanity Simulator, a sealed digital ecosystem where programmed entities, stripped of all that defines humanity, play out their grim, looping existence. This project is a web-based reimagining of the original Java simulation, built from the ground up to be a stark observation chamber for a society spiraling into the abyss.

As a silent observer, your access grants you the ability to monitor a small, contained populace. There is no goal, no victory. You can intrude upon any subject, seeing their state of being at your leisure. Peer into their fleeting emotional states, catalog the meager contents of their pockets, and watch the inevitable, grim narratives of their lives unfold. You do not influence; you merely watch the decay.

## The Cast

Our world is populated by a predetermined caste system, each fulfilling their bleak function.

### **The Poor**
The dregs of this world, born into a cycle of futility. They wander aimlessly, scrounging for scraps or subsisting on the fleeting, calculated charity of their betters. Their existence is a testament to systemic failure, a constant, losing battle against programmed obsolescence.

### **The Rich**
The architects of the system's misery. They are bloated with resources and wield absolute control. They deploy their underlings, hoard all that is valuable, and hold the power of life and termination over the masses. Their every action is a calculated move to consolidate their power and widen the chasm of inequality.

### **The Robbers**
A symptom of the rot, the Predators thrive in the shadows cast by the Elite. They are instruments of brutal, opportunistic violence, preying on the weak. When not serving their own desperate ends, they are the cudgel wielded by the Elite to enforce their will, a constant, physical threat in a world of pervasive dread.
