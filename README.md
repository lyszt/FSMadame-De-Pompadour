# Humanity Simulator
## I see humans, but no humanity.
-- 

Welcome to Humanity Simulator, a dynamic and interactive web-based world where characters with distinct personalities and social standings come to life. This project is a complete reimagining of the original concept, built from the ground up with a modern tech stack to create a visually stunning and engaging user experience.

## The Idea üí°

It will be an interactive simulation where you can observe and influence a small society of characters. Unlike its predecessor, this version will be on the web, featuring a beautiful and intuitive interface. The core of the experience will be the ability to interact directly with the characters. Imagine a world where you can click on any person to see their current emotions, what they are carrying in their inventory, and witness their stories unfold.

## The Characters üßç

Our world is populated by three distinct types of characters, each with their own motivations and behaviors:

### **The Poor**
These are humble individuals, often struggling to get by. They can be found wandering the world, sometimes finding lost items or receiving alms from others. Their lives are a constant struggle, but they are resilient.

### **The Rich**
The elite of this world, the Rich are powerful and influential. They have the means to hire lackeys, acquire valuable items, and even decide the fate of others. Their actions are driven by a desire to maintain and grow their wealth and power.

### **The Robber**
Living in the shadows, the Robbers are opportunistic and dangerous. They may steal from the unsuspecting or even resort to violence. They can also be hired by the Rich to do their dirty work, adding a layer of intrigue and danger to the world.

And several others still to be added.
