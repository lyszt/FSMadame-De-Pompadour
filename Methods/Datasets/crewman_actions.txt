calibrates the nav-computer for the tenth time
stares blankly out the viewport into the starfield
splices a frayed power conduit with methodical precision
taps a restless rhythm on a rusty bulkhead
runs diagnostics on the life support system
sips a murky synth-ale from a dented mug
cleans carbon scoring off a well-used tool
watches static on a deactivated monitor
scrolls aimlessly through old, corrupted ship logs
sharpens a knife on a worn magnetic strip
listens intently to the hum of the ship's engine
traces the stress fractures on the viewport glass
pulls up local security camera feeds out of habit
laughs dryly at a corporate news broadcast
reviews a star-chart of a system they'll never visit
patches a minor pressure leak with sealant tape
checks the seal on their vac-suit... again
re-reads a faded, data-chipped novel
whistles a discordant, off-world tune
organizes spare parts into neat, obsessive piles
practices zero-g sleight-of-hand with a worn coin
wipes grime off a control panel to read a faded label
filters the last dregs from a water reclaimer
stretches languidly in the low gravity
makes a rude gesture at a passing corporate freighter
studies the wiring schematics of the ship
talks to the ship's computer as if it were a person
does pull-ups on an exposed pipe
polishes a small, strange alien artifact
sleeps with one hand resting on a control panel
traces constellations on a dusty console
juggles a handful of ball bearings
hums along to the thrum of the FTL drive cooling down
marks another cycle on the bulkhead with a piece of chalk
re-winds a roll of duct tape perfectly
stares at their own reflection in a dark monitor
meticulously cleans their fingernails with a small knife
drafts a reply to a message they'll never send
times the intervals between the flickering lights in the corridor
re-calibrates the atmospheric moisture sensors
purges the secondary fuel injectors
defrosts the external sensor array
tests the battery life of their emergency beacon
applies lubricant to a squeaking airlock hinge
cross-references a faulty diagnostic with an old paper manual
brews a potent, bitter coffee from ground-up ration bars
sews a patch onto their worn-out flight suit
tries to bypass the encryption on a locked data slate
deletes old, unread messages without opening them
plays a simple, repetitive video game on a handheld device
listens to garbled transmissions on the long-range comms
leaves an anonymous, critical comment on a public news forum
runs a simulation of a catastrophic hull breach, just to watch
scans the local network for unsecured comms channels
paces the length of the cargo bay, counting each step
sits in the pilot's chair, not touching any controls
tosses a wrench up and catches it in zero-g
tries to hold their breath for as long as possible
stares at a nutrition paste packet, trying to remember real food
flexes their hands to stave off cramps from microgravity
deliberately misfiles a low-priority maintenance report
changes the ship computer's voice to something obnoxious
uses a corporate logo for target practice with a low-power laser
eats their rations slowly, as if protesting their blandness
mutes a ship-wide broadcast from a corporate official
looks at a faded photograph of a person from their past
traces a name carved into their bunk
tries to remember the smell of real rain
reads the ingredients on a food packet, pronouncing each chemical name
tightens the bolts on a floor panel just to feel useful
watches dust motes dance in a single beam of light
cracks their knuckles, one by one, with deliberate slowness
tunes a battered string instrument found in the hold
checks the ship's chronometer against their own personal timepiece
draws a detailed, imaginary alien creature on a spare napkin
practices walking silently on the metal deck
reviews the ship's inventory, sighing at the dwindling supplies
flips through a manual for a piece of equipment that broke long ago
sits in complete darkness, letting their eyes adjust
taps out a coded message to no one in particular on a console
re-routes non-essential power to the main drive, just in case
holds a cold tool to their forehead
gazes at a distant nebula, wondering what's there
empties a small pouch of debris from their pocket, examining each piece
reviews experiment data on a ruggedized laptop
calibrates a sensor for a microgravity study
organizes a tangle of cables with velcro straps
wipes condensation off a viewport
inspects the seals on an internal hatch
updates a shared procedure on the station's digital wiki
logs their daily tasks in the mission planner
observes crystal growth in a sealed container
sorts fluid samples in a microgravity science glovebox
watches a pre-downloaded movie on a tablet
listens to music on headphones, floating cross-legged
performs their daily allotted exercise on the resistive machine
stretches carefully to alleviate back pain from microgravity
squeezes a water bubble out of a pouch and watches it float
records a personal video log for psychological evaluation
cleans a panel with an antiseptic wipe
re-reads a worn paperback book in their sleep station
updates the station's inventory of spare parts
runs a diagnostic on an air scrubber filter
checks the readouts on the station's primary life support
floats motionless for a moment, eyes closed
practices maneuvering a robotic arm on a simulator
reviews emergency EVA procedures, just in case
photographs a lightning storm over the Pacific Ocean
listens to a briefing from mission control
prepares a rehydrated meal packet
tidies their personal sleeping quarters
checks the growth of plants in the Veggie unit
floats through the length of the station, just to move
secures loose items to the wall with bungee cords
listens to the quiet hum and click of the station's machinery
examines their own reflection in the dark glass of a monitor
writes notes on a waterproof slate
