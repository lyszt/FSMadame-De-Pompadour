tends to a garden of imaginary flowers
searches pockets frantically, then smiles
plays a melancholic tune on a broken violin
laughs hysterically at nothing in particular
watches the football match between Real Sanction and Ironville United
shadows someone from a distance, giggling
waves a stick like a sword in mock combat
folds paper into intricate shapes and releases them to the wind
writes poems in the dirt with a stick
sips tea from an empty cup
recites lines from a play to no audience
laughs at the rain falling on their hands
paces back and forth while muttering softly
sketches people passing by in a tattered notebook
collects cigarette butts from the ground
licks raindrops off a rusty fence
holds a debate with an empty chair
gazes longingly at a closed window
draws constellations in the dust
lights a candle and stares at the flame
waves at every person who walks by
chases after a floating plastic bag
carves initials into a tree trunk
sits cross-legged, eyes closed, breathing deeply
traces their shadow with a stick
talks to a portrait clutched in hand
draws strange symbols on the wall with chalk
hums a forgotten lullaby
feeds stray cats gathered around a bench
organizes pebbles by color and size
stares blankly into the setting sun
pretends to direct traffic with dramatic gestures
throws breadcrumbs to invisible birds
balances stones into small towers
counts the cracks in the pavement
runs around the square aimlessly
spins in circles until collapsing dizzy
claps twice before every step
mimics bird calls with surprising accuracy
dances slowly to music only they can hear
