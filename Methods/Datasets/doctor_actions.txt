reviews a patient's psychological evaluation file
calibrates the sensitivity of a bio-scanner
cross-references a strange symptom in a galactic medical database
sterilizes surgical instruments with a low-humming autoclave
runs a diagnostic on the medical bay's air filtration system
sips a cup of calming herbal tea while reading a datapad
cleans a small bloodstain from the medbay floor
watches a holographic surgical simulation
scrolls through research papers on xenobiology
sharpens a bone saw with meticulous care
listens intently to the rhythmic beep of a heart monitor
traces the cellular structure of a virus on a holographic display
pulls up crew vitals on the main console out of habit
chuckles softly at a misdiagnosis in an old medical text
reviews a chart of an alien species' nervous system
patches a minor tear in a biohazard suit
checks the seal on a quarantine container... again
re-reads a chapter from a worn medical ethics textbook
whistles a calm, classical tune
organizes hyposprays into neat, color-coded rows
practices suturing on a synthetic skin graft
wipes down a surgical table with a strong antiseptic
filters a compound for a new sedative
stretches their back after leaning over a microscope
makes a critical note on a public health bulletin
studies the schematics of the ship's life support system
talks to the medical computer as if it were a colleague
does precise finger exercises to keep their hands steady
polishes the lens of a high-powered microscope
sleeps with one hand resting on a medical tricorder
traces neural pathways on a dusty anatomical chart
juggles a handful of sterile sample vials
hums along to the quiet whir of the diagnostic equipment
marks another cycle on a quarantine observation chart
re-stocks a roll of synth-flesh bandages perfectly
stares at their own reflection in a dark monitor
meticulously cleans under their fingernails with a surgical pick
drafts a confidential medical report for the captain
times the intervals between a patient's simulated breaths
re-calibrates the atmospheric composition sensors in the medbay
purges the secondary bio-filters
defrosts the cryo-storage unit
tests the battery life of an emergency defibrillator
applies sealant to a cracking sample container
cross-references a patient's allergy list with a new medication
brews a weak, bitter coffee from a ration pack
sews a patch onto their worn-out medical coat
tries to decrypt a section of a classified medical file
deletes old, resolved patient alerts without opening them
plays a complex anatomical puzzle game on a handheld device
listens to garbled chatter from a colony's medical channel
leaves an anonymous, helpful comment on a public medical forum
runs a simulation of a ship-wide pandemic response
scans the local network for medical supply manifests
paces the length of the medical bay, observing each station
sits in the diagnostic chair, not touching any controls
tosses a hypospray up and catches it deftly
tries to hold their breath to practice steadying their hands
stares at a nutrition paste packet, mentally listing its deficiencies
flexes their hands to maintain dexterity
deliberately archives a low-priority health bulletin
changes the medical computer's voice to something more soothing
uses a biohazard symbol for target practice with a low-power laser
eats their rations quickly between tasks
mutes a ship-wide broadcast to focus on their work
looks at a faded photograph of their graduating class
traces a diagram of the circulatory system
tries to remember the smell of a real hospital
reads the chemical composition of a stimulant, murmuring each name
tightens the fittings on a fluid analysis machine
watches cells divide under a digital microscope
cracks their neck with a slow, deliberate motion
tunes a sonic resonator to a calming frequency
checks the ship's chronometer against a patient's recovery schedule
draws a detailed, accurate diagram of a human heart
practices walking silently on the medbay deck
reviews the ship's inventory of rare antivirals
flips through a manual for a piece of outdated diagnostic equipment
sits in the quiet, sterile environment, letting their mind rest
taps out a medical shorthand message to no one in particular
re-routes backup power to the cryo-stasis pods, just in case
holds a cold instrument to their forehead to focus
gazes at a distant star, contemplating the fragility of life
empties a small pouch of used medical supplies, sorting them for disposal
